  # Fix Row-Level Security Policies for Projects Table

  1. Security Updates
    - Completely drop and recreate all RLS policies for projects table
    - Ensure proper public access for authenticated users to create and manage their projects
    - Add explicit permissions that resolve the "new row violates row-level security policy" error
    - Add additional logging for policy violations to aid debugging
    
  This migration addresses the persistent "new row violates row-level security policy" 
  errors by restructuring security policies with explicit permissions.
