/**
 * UNUSED COMPONENT
 * 
 * This component is not currently used in the application.
 * It exists as a placeholder and is kept for potential future use or reference.
 * 
 * The main sidebar navigation is built directly into DashboardLayout.tsx.
 * There is also another sidebar component at /src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx
 * which has a full implementation but also appears to be unused.
