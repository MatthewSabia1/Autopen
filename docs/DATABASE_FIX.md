# Database and Authentication Debug Guide

## Current Status

The application is experiencing the following issues:

1. **Missing Products**: The products page is not displaying any products despite them existing in the database
2. **Authentication Errors**: The console shows "User not authenticated" errors in some contexts
3. **Database Schema Issues**: Some tables may not exist or have incorrect structure
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Type definitions for workflow steps and other entities

## Diagnostics Performed

1. **Database Schema Verification**:
   - Confirmed `creator_contents` table exists and has proper structure
   - Verified Row Level Security (RLS) policies are in place
   - Tested direct insertion of test products

2. **Authentication Flow Testing**:
   - Added extensive debug logging to trace authentication process
   - Tested session persistence and token validation
   - Verified user ID matching between auth and database queries

3. **Data Access Checks**:
   - Created test products via admin API
   - Confirmed products exist in the database
   - Tested RLS policies with authenticated requests

## Identified Issues

1. **Authentication Flow Issues**:
   - The primary issue appears to be related to authentication state management
   - Session persistence might be failing between page navigation
   - The auth context may not be properly synchronized with Supabase's auth state

2. **Database Access Problems**:
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies may be too restrictive
   - The `user_id` in database records might not match the authenticated user's ID

3. **Code Structure Issues**:
   - Circular dependencies between auth context and hooks
   - Inconsistent error handling during authentication checks

## Debug Tools Created

1. **supabase-test.js**: Comprehensive diagnostics tool that:
   - Verifies database schema and tables
   - Tests authentication flow with a temporary user
   - Checks existing products and user access

2. **create-product.js**: Helper script to create test products for specific users

3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added detailed console logging to:
   - Authentication context
   - Products hook
   - Login process
   - Database queries

## Fix Recommendations

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Ensure consistent user ID format throughout the application
   - Check for token expiration and implement auto-refresh
   - Add local caching of authentication state

2. **Database Access**:
   - Verify RLS policies allow proper access for authenticated users
   - Check if `user_id` in products matches the authenticated user ID format
   - Temporarily disable RLS for testing (in development only)

3. **User Experience**:
   - Implement better error messages for authentication failures
   - Add a "Create First Product" prompt when no products exist
   - Improve loading states during authentication checks

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Open browser developer tools console
2. Navigate to the login page and sign in
3. Check the console logs for the authentication process
4. Navigate to the products page
5. Verify if products are displayed or what error occurs
6. Compare the user ID in authentication logs with the products in the database

## Temporary Fixes

If authentication issues persist, consider these temporary measures:

1. **Bypass Authentication Check**:
   ```javascript
   // In useProducts.ts, modify fetchProducts
   const { data: user } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   
   // Temporarily bypass auth check for testing
   const testUserID = "73e9cee8-06bb-47f8-b915-a28015c5f11b"; // Known user ID
   
   if (!user || !user.user) {
     console.warn("Auth bypass: Using test user ID");
     return await fetchProductsFromDatabase(testUserID);
     // Comment out the line below during testing
     // throw new Error("User not authenticated");
   }
   ```

2. **Disable RLS Temporarily**:
   ```sql
   -- Run this in Supabase SQL editor (DEVELOPMENT ONLY!)
   ALTER TABLE creator_contents DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   
   -- Don't forget to re-enable after testing
   -- ALTER TABLE creator_contents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

## Long-term Solutions

1. **Improve Authentication Architecture**:
   - Implement a more robust auth state management system
   - Add refresh token handling and session recovery
   - Consider using a dedicated auth management library

2. **Database Schema Management**:
   - Create a comprehensive migration system
   - Add validation checks before querying tables
   - Implement schema version tracking

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Add more specific error types and messages
   - Implement proper fallback UI for auth failures
   - Add telemetry for detecting auth issues in production

## Conclusion

The main issue appears to be authentication state synchronization between the Supabase client and the React application state. The added debugging tools and logs should help identify the exact point of failure in the authentication flow, allowing for a targeted fix.

Use the debug session to determine if the issue is with:
1. Initial authentication
2. Session persistence
3. Token expiration/refresh
4. User ID format mismatches
5. RLS policy configuration
